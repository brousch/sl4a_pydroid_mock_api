Status of Various Simulated Functions
=====================================

makeToast
---------

*Complete
Pops up a Tkinter window in the middle of your screen for 5 seconds. The window
contains the message you've specified.

recognizeSpeech
---------------

*Partial
At this time, recognizeSpeech does not attempt to actually recognize any speech.
It prompts you for a string to return as though speech had been recognized. You
can reply with any string you want, which is useful for seeing how your code
handes correctly and incorrectly recognized speech. Improving this function to
actually use Google's speech recognition engine would be awesome.

ttsIsSpeaking
-------------

*Partial
The function ttsIsSpeaking simulated checks to see whether ttsSpeak has
finished saying something. It returns True if ttsSpeak is done, and False if it 
is still speaking. The simulated function returns True or False at random, so
it lets you know that your code running the function has processed, but it
doesn't actually perform a check. This might be improved in the future.

ttsSpeak
--------

*Complete
On OSX, it uses the built-in 'say' program. No action is necessary.

On Linux, you can install flite, a free, small, widely-avilable TTS program.

On Windows, we do not currently support any TTS engines.

If no TTS functionality is found, it will default to printing the message to the
console.

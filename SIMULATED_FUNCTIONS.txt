Status of Various Simulated Functions
=====================================

recognizeSpeech
---------------

*Partial
At this time, recognizeSpeech does not attempt to actually recognize any speech.
It prompts you for a string to return as though speech had been recognized. You
can reply with any string you want, which is useful for seeing how your code
handes correctly and incorrectly recognized speech. Improving this function to
actually use Google's speech recognition engine would be awesome.

ttsIsSpeaking
-------------

*Partial
The function ttsIsSpeaking simulated checks to see whether ttsSpeak has
finished saying something. It returns True if ttsSpeak is done, and False if it 
is still speaking. The simulated function returns True or False at random, so
it lets you know that your code running the function has processed, but it
doesn't actually perform a check. This might be improved in the future.

ttsSpeak
--------

*Complete
Uses the PyTTSx module to provide text to speech on your computer. PyTTSx
requires that you have an external TTS library or program installed. On Linux, 
this is espeak. On OSX this is the NSSpeechSynthesizer. On Windows this is
SAPI5.

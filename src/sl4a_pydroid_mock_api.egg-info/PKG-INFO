Description: A Mock API for SL4A's Python Android API
        ========================================
        
        This project provides an API to mimic the Python API provided by the `Scripting
        Language for Android`_ project. The SL4A Android API can only be run on an
        actual Android device, which can make development cumbersome. This project
        provides an API very similar to the one on Android, but it is designed for use
        on a desktop operating system such as Linux, OSX, and Windows.
        
        The SL4A Android API is very large and allows you to interact with almost
        every part of the Android operating system. For each of these features I have
        to find a similar desktop feature and hook into it. Sometimes there is nothing
        similar available. Because of this, this project will likely never be able to 
        emulate every piece of the API.
        
        I am building this project as I come across SL4A Python API features that I
        need to use. At the present time, I am not attempting to simulate the entire 
        API. If you need a feature that hasn't yet been implemented, please fork this 
        project, code it up, and make a pull request. Your contributions will be 
        welcomed.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        From your SL4A project's virtualenv: *pip install sl4a_pydroid_api*
        
        This creates an *android* module which you can import from just like a regular
        SL$A project.

        *Release date: 16-Jul-2012*
        
        * Added support for makeToast via a Tkinter window.
        * Added a shim module for TTS on OSX since I couldn't get PyTTSx working
          outside of the OSX system Python.

        * This initial release of the project includes a working implementation of the 
          **ttsSpeak** method using PyTTSx. It also includes partial implementations 
          of the **ttsIsSpeaking** and **recognizeSpeech** functions. See the 
          SIMULATED_FUNCTIONS.TXT file for more details.
